SLRV Codex CLI is a research fork of the OpenAI Codex CLI with the SLRV framework embedded at the agent level.
It proves that SLRV is executable: agent behavior is normatively gated inside a real autonomous coding workflow.

In SLRV Codex:

- agent outputs are claims, not evidence
- warrants cannot be upgraded without new observations
- build, commit, and promotion require joint authority and capacity
- refusals are produced by normative reasoning, not policy or tooling

As a result:

**Progress that would normally be self-licensed by protocol compliance becomes structurally impossible.**
