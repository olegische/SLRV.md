# FR-0001: Analytics And SLRV-Codex Info

## Context

This document is a PROPOSAL for requirements. The system is the `slrv.md` one-pager hosted on Cloudflare Pages. The source of truth for the `slrv-codex` information section is `CODEX.md` in the repository root, and its content must be reflected verbatim on the site.

## Actors

- Site visitor
- Site owner

## Functional Requirements

- FR-1: When a site visitor loads any page of the one-pager, the system MUST record a page view event.
- FR-2: When a site visitor clicks an external link, the system MUST record a click event for that outbound link.
- FR-3: When a site visitor scrolls through the one-pager, the system MUST record scroll-depth events at 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% thresholds.
- FR-4: When a site visitor is on a page, the system MUST record time-on-page for that visit.
- FR-5: When analytics data is collected, the system MUST NOT display analytics data in the site UI.
- FR-6: When analytics data is collected, the system MUST NOT collect personally identifiable information (PII).
- FR-7: When the one-pager renders the `slrv-codex` information section, the system MUST render the full contents of `CODEX.md` verbatim.
- FR-8: When the one-pager renders the `slrv-codex` information section, the system MUST place it immediately after the About block.
- FR-9: When `CODEX.md` changes, the `slrv-codex` information section MUST reflect the updated contents.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- NFR-1: The site MUST remain hosted on Cloudflare Pages.
- NFR-2: The system MUST NOT add a login feature.
- NFR-3: No additional performance, availability, or internationalization requirements are specified at this time.

## Explicit Non-Goals

- The system MUST NOT add login or authentication.
- The system MUST NOT provide an on-site analytics dashboard or reporting UI.

## Assumptions

- The one-pager has a distinct About block that can be used as a placement anchor for the `slrv-codex` section.
- Selection of the analytics provider is deferred until implementation.

## Open Questions

- Is cookie-less analytics a hard requirement or a preference?
- Are IP addresses or persistent identifiers considered PII for this project?
- Which analytics provider should be used (Cloudflare analytics or Google Analytics, or another option)?
