# FR-0001: SLRV One-Page Web Presentation

## Context

Classification: PROPOSAL

This document specifies requirements for a static, one-page web presentation of the SLRV framework.

The intended audience is software engineers building software using SWE agents (initially: Codex CLI, Claude Code, Cursor-Agent), with potential expansion to other audiences later.

Primary user goal: copy an "AGENTS.md-ready" markdown section titled "SLRV Framework" into their clipboard for pasting into a repository `AGENTS.md`, and treat the site as a source of truth for SLRV.

Canonical sources for site content (repository files):
- Framework overview/description: `ABOUT.md`
- Copyable "SLRV Framework" code block: `SLRV.md`
- Semantic Laundering section: `SL.md`
- Responsibility Vacuum section: `RV.md`

External references for SLRV provenance (linked from the site):
- arXiv (Semantic Laundering): https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08333
- arXiv (Responsibility Vacuum): https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15059

Language requirement (current release): English-only.

## Actors

- Visitor (Primary): an engineer reading SLRV and copying the "SLRV Framework" section into their `AGENTS.md`.
- Maintainer (Secondary): updates the SLRV/SL/RV texts over time in the repository.

## Functional Requirements

- FR-1: The system MUST provide a single, one-page web presentation of the SLRV framework in English.
- FR-2: The page MUST present an "SLRV Framework" section intended to be copied verbatim into a repository `AGENTS.md` ("AGENTS.md-ready").
- FR-3: The "SLRV Framework" section MUST be displayed in a visible code-style area and MUST have a copy-to-clipboard control.
- FR-4: When the visitor activates the copy control, the system MUST copy the full "SLRV Framework" markdown content to the clipboard.
- FR-5: The copy interaction behavior (including any visible feedback, if present) MUST match the behavior used by the reference implementation at https://github.com/agentsmd/agents.md.
- FR-6: The page MUST include separate sections for Semantic Laundering and Responsibility Vacuum, presented below the primary SLRV framework description and copy block, to support deeper understanding.
- FR-7: The page MUST include internal anchor navigation to sections (one-page anchors).
- FR-8: The page MUST include external links to (at minimum) the two arXiv papers (Semantic Laundering and Responsibility Vacuum) and the project GitHub repository: https://github.com/olegische/SLRV.md
- FR-9: The published site content MUST be derived exclusively from the canonical repository files listed in the Context section.
- FR-10: The system MUST allow the SLRV/SL/RV content to be updated over time.
- FR-11: The page MUST NOT display content versions to visitors (e.g., no visible version numbers or dates for SLRV/SL/RV), and MUST instead provide a link to GitHub as the place to inspect history.
- FR-12: The system MUST NOT include interactive features other than copy-to-clipboard and navigation/external links.
- FR-13: The copyable "SLRV Framework" markdown content MUST be sourced verbatim from `SLRV.md` and copied verbatim as markdown.
- FR-14: The Semantic Laundering section content MUST be sourced verbatim from `SL.md` and presented as readable page content (not as the copyable code block).
- FR-15: The Responsibility Vacuum section content MUST be sourced verbatim from `RV.md` and presented as readable page content (not as the copyable code block).
- FR-16: The framework overview/description content MUST be derived from `ABOUT.md`, adapted for website presentation without introducing new claims or interpretations beyond `ABOUT.md`.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- NFR-1: The system MUST be a static site suitable for deployment on Cloudflare (no backend requirements).
- NFR-2: Responsiveness/adaptive behavior MUST match the `agents.md` reference site to the extent applicable.
- NFR-3: Accessibility behavior MUST match the `agents.md` reference site to the extent applicable.
- NFR-4: Copy-to-clipboard behavior and related UI interaction patterns MUST be implemented by direct reuse or direct adaptation of reference code from https://github.com/agentsmd/agents.md, and MUST NOT be independently reimplemented or approximated from memory.
- NFR-5: No explicit performance targets (latency, throughput, LCP) are required at this stage.
- NFR-6: The repository MUST include explicit provenance documentation for any reused or adapted copy-to-clipboard behavior from the https://github.com/agentsmd/agents.md reference, including upstream file paths and a specific upstream commit hash, tag, or release identifier.

## Explicit Non-Goals

- Comments and discussion features.
- Search.
- Authentication, sessions, or user accounts.
- News feeds or dynamic updates.
- On-site text generation/summarization features.
- Forms or data submission workflows.
- Any interactivity beyond copy-to-clipboard and links/anchor navigation.
- Internationalization (i18n) in the current release (English-only is in scope; additional languages are explicitly deferred).

## Assumptions

- The `agents.md` website and/or its public repository is an acceptable reference for UI patterns and copy-to-clipboard behavior.
- It is assumed that the reference implementation code from https://github.com/agentsmd/agents.md is available to the development agent for inspection and reuse (e.g., via a local checkout).
- It is assumed that `ABOUT.md`, `SLRV.md`, `SL.md`, and `RV.md` are maintained as the source of truth for the site’s displayed and copyable content.

## Open Questions

- OQ-1: What exact internal section structure (headings/anchors) is required for the one-page layout (beyond “SLRV Framework”, “Semantic Laundering”, “Responsibility Vacuum”, and “References”)?
- OQ-2: Should the page include external links to SWE-agent tools (Codex CLI / Claude Code / Cursor-Agent), and if so, which links are required?
- OQ-3: Which browsers/devices must be supported explicitly (e.g., Chrome/Firefox/Safari/Edge; desktop/mobile)?
- OQ-4: What specific accessibility requirements are needed beyond “match `agents.md`” (keyboard navigation, ARIA labeling, contrast targets)?
- OQ-5: Are analytics/cookies/third-party embeds permitted, and if so, which ones (if none, confirm “no analytics”)?
- OQ-6: Where must MIT attribution for `agents.md`-derived UI/behavior appear (footer, README, both)?
- OQ-7: For `ABOUT.md` adaptation, what changes are permitted beyond formatting and section ordering (e.g., shortening, rewording, removing repository-specific details)?
- OQ-8: For `SL.md` and `RV.md`, is markdown-to-HTML rendering acceptable as “not in MD format”, or is a stricter non-markdown presentation required?
- OQ-9: Is a machine-checkable integrity mechanism (e.g., checksum or deterministic source marker) required to prove alignment between rendered site content and canonical repository files?
