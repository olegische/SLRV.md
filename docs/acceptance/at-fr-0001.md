## Acceptance Tests

### AT-1: Single-page English SLRV presentation
- Traces to: FR-1
- Preconditions: The site is built and served at its root URL.
- Action: Load the root URL in a browser.
- Expected Outcome: A single page presents the SLRV framework content in English; required content is accessible on this page without mandatory navigation to other pages.

### AT-2: SLRV Framework section is present and copyable
- Traces to: FR-2, FR-3
- Preconditions: The site is loaded.
- Action: Locate the section titled "SLRV Framework".
- Expected Outcome: The section is present, displayed in a visible code-style area, and includes a copy-to-clipboard control adjacent to or within that area.

### AT-3: Copy control copies exact SLRV markdown
- Traces to: FR-4, FR-9, FR-13
- Preconditions: Clipboard access is permitted; the page is loaded.
- Action: Activate the copy control in the "SLRV Framework" section, then paste the clipboard contents into a plain-text destination.
- Expected Outcome: The clipboard content matches `SLRV.md` verbatim, preserving markdown formatting and full content.

### AT-4: Copy interaction matches the reference implementation
- Traces to: FR-5
- Preconditions: Access to the reference implementation behavior from https://github.com/agentsmd/agents.md.
- Action: Trigger the copy control on the SLRV page and on the reference implementation, observing visible feedback and clipboard behavior.
- Expected Outcome: The copy interaction behavior (including any visible feedback, if present) matches the reference implementation.

### AT-5: SL and RV sections appear below the primary SLRV section
- Traces to: FR-6
- Preconditions: The site is loaded.
- Action: Scroll the page from the top through the SLRV Framework section.
- Expected Outcome: Separate sections for Semantic Laundering and Responsibility Vacuum appear below the primary SLRV framework description and copy block.

### AT-6: Internal anchor navigation to key sections
- Traces to: FR-7
- Preconditions: The site is loaded.
- Action: Use internal navigation links to jump to the "SLRV Framework", "Semantic Laundering", and "Responsibility Vacuum" sections.
- Expected Outcome: Each link navigates to the corresponding section on the same page and updates the URL fragment accordingly.

### AT-7: Required external references are linked
- Traces to: FR-8
- Preconditions: The site is loaded.
- Action: Inspect external links on the page.
- Expected Outcome: The page includes links to:
  - https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08333
  - https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15059
  - https://github.com/olegische/SLRV.md

### AT-8: SL and RV content sourced from canonical files
- Traces to: FR-9, FR-14, FR-15
- Preconditions: Access to repository files `SL.md` and `RV.md`.
- Action: Compare the rendered Semantic Laundering and Responsibility Vacuum sections to the contents of `SL.md` and `RV.md`.
- Expected Outcome: Section content matches `SL.md` and `RV.md` verbatim and is presented as readable page content (not as the copyable code block).

### AT-9: Overview content derived from ABOUT.md
- Traces to: FR-9, FR-16
- Preconditions: Access to repository file `ABOUT.md`.
- Action: Compare the framework overview/description content on the page to `ABOUT.md`.
- Expected Outcome: The overview is derived from `ABOUT.md` and does not introduce new claims or interpretations beyond `ABOUT.md`.

### AT-10: Canonical content updates propagate to the site
- Traces to: FR-10
- Preconditions: Ability to update canonical files and rebuild or redeploy the site.
- Action: Change the content of one canonical file (`ABOUT.md`, `SLRV.md`, `SL.md`, or `RV.md`), then rebuild/redeploy.
- Expected Outcome: The published site reflects the updated content from the changed canonical file.

### AT-11: No visible content versions; GitHub link present
- Traces to: FR-11
- Preconditions: The site is loaded.
- Action: Inspect the page for visible version numbers or dates specifically tied to SLRV/SL/RV content and locate the GitHub link.
- Expected Outcome: No visible version numbers or dates for SLRV/SL/RV content are displayed, and a link to the GitHub repository is present for history inspection.

### AT-12: Static site suitable for Cloudflare hosting
- Traces to: NFR-1
- Preconditions: Build output is available.
- Action: Inspect the build artifacts.
- Expected Outcome: The site consists of static files that can be served without a backend runtime.

### AT-13: Copy behavior reused or adapted from reference code
- Traces to: NFR-4
- Preconditions: Access to the implementation source and the reference repository https://github.com/agentsmd/agents.md.
- Action: Compare the copy-to-clipboard implementation code to the upstream reference.
- Expected Outcome: The implementation is a direct reuse or direct adaptation of the reference code and is not independently reimplemented from memory.

### AT-14: Provenance documentation for reused/adapted code
- Traces to: NFR-6
- Preconditions: Access to repository documentation.
- Action: Locate provenance documentation for reused/adapted copy-to-clipboard behavior.
- Expected Outcome: Documentation includes upstream file paths and a specific upstream commit hash, tag, or release identifier.

## Negative Acceptance Tests

### NAT-1: Prohibited features and interactivity are absent
- Traces to: FR-12
- Preconditions: The site is loaded.
- Action: Inspect the page for interactive features or content beyond copy-to-clipboard and navigation/external links.
- Expected Outcome: The page does NOT include comments/discussion, search, authentication/sessions/accounts, news feeds or dynamic updates, on-site text generation/summarization, forms or data submission workflows, or interactivity beyond copy-to-clipboard and links/anchor navigation. Internationalization is not present (English-only).

## Notes

- NFR-5 is not acceptance-testable as written because it specifies the absence of required performance targets rather than observable system behavior.
- This document is a DERIVATION artifact and requires human review and acceptance.
